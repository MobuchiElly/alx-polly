### Security Audit Report Summary

**1. `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`**

*   **Issues:**
    *   **Exposed Public Anon Key:** Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, increasing attack surface if Row-Level Security (RLS) is not strict.
    *   **Weak Cookie Handling:** Missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` flags, leading to potential XSS/CSRF.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** Lacks role-based access control (RBAC), allowing any logged-in user to access restricted areas.
    *   **Lack of CSRF and Rate Limiting:** No protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or request rate limiting.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Use Supabase Service Role Key for privileged server-side checks.
    *   Enforce secure cookie options (`httpOnly: true`, `secure: true`, `sameSite: 'strict'`).
    *   Implement role checks in middleware (e.g., for `/admin` routes).
    *   Add CSRF protection and implement rate limiting.

**2. `lib/supabase/client.ts`**

*   **Issues:**
    *   **Use of Anon Key:** Relies on RLS for data protection; misconfiguration could expose sensitive data.
    *   **Risk of Service Role Key Exposure:** No safeguards to prevent accidental use of the service role key.
    *   **Lack of Environment Variable Validation:** Uses non-null assertions (`!`) without validation, risking runtime crashes or error message exposure.
    *   **Session and Cookie Handling:** Relies on Supabase defaults; weak session enforcement if RLS is not strong.
    *   **No Documentation for Developers:** Lacks comments on security boundaries, risking misuse.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Add runtime validation for environment variables.
    *   Clearly document that only the anon key should be used.
    *   Confirm RLS is enabled and enforced across all database tables.
    *   Use server-side Supabase client (`server.ts`) for privileged operations.
    *   Add comments/warnings to guide developers.

**3. `app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`**

*   **Issues:**
    *   **Missing Input Validation:** `login()` and `register()` directly trust user input without sanitization or validation, leading to weak passwords, XSS, etc.
    *   **Weak Error Handling:** Returns raw Supabase error messages, potentially leaking internal details.
    *   **Authentication Flows:** No rate limiting or lockout for `login()`; no email confirmation or abuse safeguards for `register()`.
    *   **Logout() Issues:** Does not ensure session cookies are securely invalidated.
    *   **`getCurrentUser()` and `getSession()`:** Could expose sensitive JWT claims if returned unfiltered.
    *   **General Weaknesses:** No RBAC, audit logging, CSRF protection, or rate limiting.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and account lockouts for failed login attempts.
    *   Sanitize and validate user input, enforce strong password policies, and avoid returning raw error messages.
    *   Ensure secure session cookie handling (`httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite`).
    *   Add CSRF protection for state-changing operations.
    *   Filter user and session data returned to the client.
    *   Add logging for authentication events.
    *   Review Supabase RLS policies.

**4. `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts`**

*   **Issues:**
    *   **`createPoll`:** No input sanitization/validation beyond presence checks, risking stored XSS, database abuse, or DoS. Direct exposure of Supabase errors.
    *   **`getUserPolls`:** Returns entire rows, potentially exposing sensitive metadata. No pagination or rate limiting.
    *   **`getPollById`:** No access control, allowing unauthorized access to any poll by ID. Returns full row data.
    *   **`submitVote`:** Allows voting without authentication, risking poll manipulation. No duplicate vote prevention or `optionIndex` validation.
    *   **`deletePoll`:** Deletes based on ID without ownership check, a critical access control vulnerability. No soft-delete or audit logging.
    *   **`updatePoll`:** Lacks input sanitization, risking injection. No length/structural validation for options.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
    *   Map database errors to safe, user-friendly messages.
    *   Return only necessary fields from queries.
    *   Implement access control for `getPollById` and `deletePoll`.
    *   Enforce authentication for voting, prevent duplicate votes, and validate `optionIndex`.
    *   Implement soft-delete and audit logging for sensitive operations.

**5. `app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`**

*   **Issues:**
    *   **Client-side use of public/anon Supabase client:** Relies on RLS for admin data, fragile if misconfigured.
    *   **No server-side admin authorization check:** Anyone can navigate to the route.
    *   **Delete action invoked from client without proven admin authorization:** Risks arbitrary deletion of polls.
    *   **Excessive data returned to the client:** `select("*")` exposes sensitive metadata.
    *   **Lack of CSRF and abuse protections:** No CSRF token, confirmation, or rate limit for delete operations.
    *   **No audit logging for admin actions:** No traceability for destructive operations.
    *   **Client-side rendering without sanitization:** Potential for stored XSS if not careful.
    *   **No pagination, search controls, or throttling:** Performance and DoS risks for large datasets.
    *   **Potential accidental exposure of server-side capabilities:** Importing server actions directly into client components.
    *   **Lack of user feedback and safe UI practices:** Immediate deletion without confirmation/undo.

*   **Prioritized Fixes:**
    *   Add server-side admin authorization middleware and protect the admin route.
    *   Create dedicated server endpoints for listing and deleting polls that enforce admin checks and use the service role key.
    *   Limit fields returned, add pagination, and enforce server-side validation and sanitization.
    *   Add CSRF protection, rate limiting, and confirmation for destructive actions.
    *   Implement audit logging for all admin actions.
    *   Avoid importing server-only functions directly into client components.
